Spectator
===================

This is a bot that listens to Portland based tech IRC channels and logs what usernames are associated with what channels.
It also keeps track of who directly references whom.
It then stores that information in memory, parses it into GraphJSON and sent to a server running the AlchemyJS visualization library.

This will allow visual community identification between individuals as well as overlap in channel membership.
